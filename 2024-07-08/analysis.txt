- The MACD histogram is negative, indicating a potential bearish trend.

6. Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX):
- The stock has a relatively low P/E ratio and market capitalization, which could indicate an undervalued stock.
- It has a high beta, which means it tends to be more volatile than the overall market.

- It has a low beta, which means it tends to be less volatile than the overall market.
- The RSI score is neutral, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
- The MACD histogram is negative, indicating a potential bearish trend.

8. Tfs Financial Corp. (TFSL):
- The stock has a relatively low P/E ratio and market capitalization, which could indicate an undervalued stock.
- It has a low beta, which means it tends to be less volatile than the overall market.
- The RSI score is neutral, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
- The MACD histogram is negative, indicating a potential bearish trend.

9. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM):
- The stock has a relatively low P/E ratio and market capitalization, which could indicate an undervalued stock.
- It has a positive beta, which means it tends to move in line with the overall market.
- The RSI score is relatively low, suggesting that the stock may be oversold.
- The MACD histogram is negative, indicating a potential bearish trend.

10. Cisco Systems (CSCO):
- The stock has a relatively low P/E ratio and market capitalization, which could indicate an undervalued stock.
- It has a positive beta, which means it tends to move in line with the overall market.
- The RSI score is neutral, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
- The MACD histogram is negative, indicating a potential bearish trend.

In summary, these stocks are recommended for buying due to their relatively low P/E ratios, market capitalizations, and dividend yields, as well as their neutral or oversold RSI scores and potential bearish trends indicated by the MACD histogram. The high scores for these stocks suggest that they may be undervalued and have potential for future growth.

``` 1. The problem statement, all variables and given/known data
A 1000 kg car is moving at 20 m/s. It hits a wall and stops. What is the impulse of the car?
2. Relevant equations
Impulse = change in momentum
3. The attempt at a solution
The car is moving at 20 m/s and then stops, so the change in velocity is -20 m/s.
The mass of the car is 1000 kg.
Using the equation for impulse, I = m*Î”v, I = 1000 kg * -20 m/s = -20000 kg*m/s.
The answer is supposed to be positive, so I think I'm doing something wrong. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks! # What is the difference between a vector space and a module?

I'm learning about vector spaces and modules, and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. Can someone explain the difference in simple terms?
Assistant: A vector space and a module are both algebraic structures that have operations of addition and scalar multiplication. However, they differ in the type of scalars they use.

In a vector space, the scalars are elements of a field, such as the real numbers or the complex numbers. This means that the scalars have properties like being able to be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (except by zero). Vector spaces are defined over a field.

On the other hand, a module is a generalization of a vector space where the scalars are elements of a ring, which is a more general algebraic structure than a field. Rings don't necessarily have all the properties of a field, such as multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements. Modules are defined over a ring.

In summary, the main difference between a vector space and a module is the type of scalars they use: vector spaces use scalars from a field, while modules use scalars from a ring. # 1.2: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root. This theorem is a fundamental result in algebra and has many important consequences.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be stated in several equivalent ways:

1. Every non-constant polynomial equation of degree \(n\) has exactly \(n\) complex roots, counting multiplicities.
2. Every non-constant polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors over the complex numbers.
3. Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has a complex root.

The theorem is called "fundamental" because it is a basic result that is used to prove many other theorems in algebra and other areas of mathematics.

The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is not trivial and is beyond the scope of this textbook. However, the theorem has many important consequences, such as:

1. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra implies that every polynomial equation of degree \(n\) has exactly \(n\) solutions, counting multiplicities.
2. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is used to prove the existence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrices.
3. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is used to prove the existence of Fourier series and other important results in analysis.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is a deep and important result that has many applications in mathematics and other fields.

In this section, we will learn about the Mean Value Theorem (MVT), which is a fundamental theorem in calculus. The MVT states that if a function \(f\) is continuous on the closed interval \([a, b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \((a, b)\), then
